# Simon Game
This repository contains the source code and assets for a simple implementation of the classic Simon game, where players must memorize and repeat an increasingly long sequence of colors. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure:

index.html: The main HTML file that serves as the entry point for the game. It sets up the basic structure of the web page and includes references to the necessary CSS and JavaScript files.

styles.css: This file contains the CSS styles used to design the user interface of the game.

game.js: The core JavaScript file that handles the game logic. It controls the sequence generation, user interaction, and checks whether the player's input matches the generated sequence. It also triggers the sounds and animations for the game.

blue.mp3, green.mp3, red.mp3, yellow.mp3: These audio files are used to provide feedback when the player presses the corresponding colored buttons. Each color has its unique sound that plays when a button is clicked or when the game displays the sequence.

wrong.mp3: This audio file is played when the player makes a mistake by pressing the wrong button. It provides immediate feedback that the sequence was not repeated correctly.

## How to Play:
Press the "Start" button to begin the game.
Watch the sequence of colors displayed by the game.
Click the buttons in the correct order to repeat the sequence.
Each correct sequence increases the difficulty by adding another color.
Try to get the highest score by repeating as many sequences as possible!
